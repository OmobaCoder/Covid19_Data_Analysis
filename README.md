## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people around the world, and Africa is no exception. As the pandemic continues, there is a growing need for accurate and up-to-date information about the spread of the virus. In this project, we analyze and visualize COVID-19 data for Nigeria and other African countries, which was scraped from the website https://ourworldindata.org/.

## Data Sources
The data used in this case study was sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/ between 1st-Jan-2020 and 30th-Apr-2021.The website provides daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries from around the world.

## Methodology
We used carried out exploratory data analysis using SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize the COVID-19 data. We uilized power bi to extract data for Nigeria and other African countries from sql database. The data cleaning process involved removing missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and aggregating the data by country and date.

After cleaning the data, we performed exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. We created visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, and heat maps to summarize the data and identify insights.

## Results
Our analysis revealed several insights about the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and other African countries, including:

The number of confirmed cases and deaths have increased significantly since the start of the pandemic.
Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in Africa, with South Africa and Tunisia also being heavily affected.
The number of new cases and deaths have started to decrease in some countries after the implementation of strict measures such as lockdowns and mask mandates.
We also created several interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash to allow users to explore the data further. These visualizations include:

A choropleth map showing the number of confirmed cases by country in Africa.
A line chart showing the trend in the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time for Nigeria and other African countries.
A bar chart showing the top 10 African countries with the highest number of confirmed cases.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 data for Nigeria and other African countries provided valuable insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic in Africa. We hope that this project helps to increase awareness of the pandemic and provides valuable information for researchers, policymakers, and the general public in Nigeria and Africa.
